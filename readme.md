# AutoHotKey script for ianxofour's Instant AFK Raid Farm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVHFIfZAL54

## How to Use
* bind attack (normally left click) to 'j', and use (normally right click) to 'k'
* make sure you have removed the fence, the trapdoor is up, and the platform is flooded (as if you have just finished killing all mobs)
* get into the killing position, aiming at the correct spot as described in the video. (make sure no mobs are present in the killing chamber)
* press the 'o' key on your keyboard to begin.
* press 'p' to finish the current loop, and stop.

## Features
* eats food in your offhand
* checks inventory briefly whilst in the bubble column
* attacks 45 times (video says around 40 are required)

## Notes
There are probably some optimisations that can be made, but this seems to work fairly well.
